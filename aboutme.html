        <p>
            Hello! I am a student studying at Chang'an University. My name is <strong> Fengze Li</strong> , and I am seeking a master's opportunity for further study. My research direction is computer science, more specifically, I am interested in AI4Science, including the application of end-to-end models in autonomous driving, the use of deep reinforcement learning for robotic control, and leveraging large language models to evaluate agents' actions in order to achieve safer and more reliable performance compared with traditional model-based methods.
        </p>

            My Interests include:
            <ul>
                <li>End-to-End model</li>
                <li>Artificial Intelligence for control</li>
                <li>Deep Reinforcement Learning at Embeded robots</li>
                <li>Autonomas Driving with Transportation</li>
            </ul>
