In this article, we present a **cooperative control model** for Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) and signalized intersections using deep reinforcement learning.

The model jointly optimizes vehicle behavior and signal timing to improve both safety and efficiency. More details will be discussed in the upcoming paper submission.
